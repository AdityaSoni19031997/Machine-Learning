# LLD

- Trying to write one LLD every day or week depedning on my availibility in Pure Python to the best of my knowledge.



> Why I am doing this despite being a MLE folk etc?

- That's how you will get hired at your dream company because you will be bound to answer the OA's and other traditional SDE rounds before anyone asks you, Can you write PyTorch/TF etc..? It may/may not be applicable for many but it holds True for a quite good chunk of orgs for sure!
